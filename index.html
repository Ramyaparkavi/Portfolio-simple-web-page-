            <p class="section-2__about"><span>I am an enthusiastic and motivated individual with a strong foundation in
                    computer science and engineering. My interests lie in software development, problem-solving, and
                    exploring emerging technologies. I enjoy working on projects that combine innovation with real-world
                    impact, such as my recent work on developing a landslide detection and warning system. With a keen
                    interest in data structures, algorithms, and Java programming, I am continuously upskilling to
                    strengthen both my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities.</span><br>

                <span> have hands-on experience with database management, operating systems, networking concepts, and
                    object-oriented programming, which help me build efficient and scalable solutions. I also enjoy
                    working with hardware–software integrated systems and documenting technical specifications in a
                    clear and structured manner. Beyond academics, I actively prepare for placements by solving
                    aptitude, coding, and core subject problems, sharpening both my logical and technical
                    skills.</span><br>

                <span>I value collaboration, adaptability, and a growth mindset, and I am eager to contribute my skills
                    to impactful projects while expanding my knowledge. My career goal is to work in a dynamic
                    environment where I can leverage my technical skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities to
                    drive innovation and deliver meaningful results.</span>”

                    <p>
                        Developed a system that detects potential landslides using an ESP32 microcontroller,<br> an
                        accelerometer to monitor ground vibrations, and a soil moisture sensor to track saturation
                        levels. When thresholds are exceeded,<br> the system triggers an alarm and displays real-time
                        data on an LCD screen for early warning in landslide-prone areas.</p>
